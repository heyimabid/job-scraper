What Does a Cannula Specialist Nurse Do? Expert in IV Cannulation A cannula specialist nurse is highly skilled in inserting peripheral IV cannulas into a patient’s vein — ensuring proper technique, aseptic (infection-free) procedures, and patient comfort. They may handle difficult venous access (hard-to-find or fragile veins) that other nurses struggle with. Infusion & IV Therapy Expertise They administer IV fluids, medications, blood products, and nutrition via cannulas following protocols. They monitor patients closely during infusions, watch for adverse reactions, and respond appropriately. Monitoring and Aftercare After inserting a cannula, this nurse checks regularly for complications (e.g., swelling, infection, infiltration). They ensure cannulas stay patent (open and working) and coordinate flushing or changing lines as needed. Educator and Mentor Many cannula specialists train and support other nurses to develop cannulation skills and competency. They may help standardize best practices for IV therapy within the nursing team. Clinical Resource & Leadership They act as a resource for clinical decision-making related to vascular access (including when to escalate to other specialists). In some hospital systems, they participate in audit, quality improvement, and policy development around cannulation care.
