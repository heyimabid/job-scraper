Application Insights View Requirements Education Experience Responsibilities & Context Join Us at Plan International Bangladesh: Make a Lasting Impact! Plan International is an independent development and humanitarian organisation that advances children’s rights and equality for girls. We believe in the power and potential of every child. But this is often suppressed by poverty, violence, exclusion and discrimination. And its girls who are most affected and mostly during crisis. Working together with children, young people, our supporters and partners, we strive for a just world, tackling the root causes of the challenges facing girls and all vulnerable children. For over 85 years, we have rallied other determined optimists to transform the lives of all children in more than 80 countries. Over the 30 years journey in Bangladesh, we envision a 2030 where children and youth, particularly girls and young women, are recognized as leaders of change in gender norms and can make decisions about their lives.

Guided by our core values, we remain unwavering in our commitment to advancing children’s rights and equality for girls so that children, especially girls, and their communities can learn, lead, decide, and thrive.
