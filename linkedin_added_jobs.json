    "job_description": "Job DescriptionIOM is committed to addressing the needs and promoting and upholding the rights of migrants.IOM’s Protection Division (PXD) aims to reduce protection risks of individuals in vulnerable situations, and in particular those who are exposed to abuse, exploitation, violence, neglect and deliberate deprivation. It does so by addressing protection threats and vulnerabilities while increasing the capacities of individuals, their communities as well as those of their duty bearers.Protection encompasses all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of the individual in accordance with the letter and spirit of the relevant bodies of law. Specifically, protection involves activities that seek to directly secure, individual or group rights, as well as activities that aim to create a society in which individual and group rights are recognized and upheld.Assistance includes all direct support activities that target individuals and their families, their communities, as well as broader structural level interventions and support to governments as duty bearers. Individual and family assistance can include support to meet immediate, medium or long-term needs including food; shelter and accommodation; healthcare; education and training; employment and/or income generation; family assessments and reunification; counseling; referrals; safe and dignified return and/or sustainable reintegration.IOM’s case management staff are at the frontline of delivery of this assistance. These staff provide case management and assistance services to a wide range of individuals, including separated and unaccompanied children; victims of trafficking; migrants vulnerable to violence, exploitation and abuse; survivors of gender-based violence, and migrants unable or unwilling to remain in host countries.Under the overall supervision of the Head of Programme and the direct supervision of the AVRR Programme Coordinator, the incumbent will be responsible for working together with beneficiaries to assess their needs, identify goals, develop an assistance plan, organize delivery of the plan, and monitor and follow up on the effectiveness of the plan in meeting the identified goals.Responsibilities Participate in efforts to identify beneficiaries eligible for IOM protection and assistance services. This may involve outreach to populations of concern, for example through community-based awareness raising sessions or assisted voluntary return and reintegration counselling sessions; responding to requests from partners to interview persons of concern; screening persons of concern in contact with IOM through protection or other programming, etc. Conduct screening and interviews with potential beneficiaries to identify protection concerns, identify protection and/or assistance needs, and/or to assess eligibility for IOM protection and assistance programmes, in line with IOM rules, standards, procedures, guidelines, forms, and templates. Inform individuals of services available from IOM or other partners, eligibility requirements for services, referral pathways, and options available to them. Maintain familiarity with available ser-vices, pathways and options to ensure accuracy of information shared. Complete intake formalities, using IOM standard intake forms, in instances where individuals are eligible for and want IOM protection and/or assistance services. Refer individuals for external services, when they are available, in instances where needs are identified but the individual is either not eligible or does not want IOM protection and/or assistance services. Conduct assessments, using and in line with relevant IOM rules, standards, procedures, guidelines, forms, and templates, to gather relevant information on individuals’ situations, needs, wishes and preferences. Based on the information gathered, develop – in consultation with the individual – a case plan that specifies the services to be provided and the objectives of the plan. Submit the plan to the case manager for approval. Directly provide – or organize for provision through referrals to other IOM units, external partners and the private sector - the services necessary to meet the needs and progress towards the objectives identified in the case plan. The services to be provided are individualized and will depend on the specific needs, but may include: shelter, health care, legal assistance, counselling, information services, documentation assistance, integration assistance, travel assistance, return assistance, reintegration assistance, assistance in accessing regular migration pathways, livelihoods support, access to education, family assessments, family reunification, and referral for best interest determinations, amongst others. Direct service delivery is to be undertaken in line with IOM rules, standards and procedures. Monitor service provision to verify that necessary services are accessed, are of appropriate quality, and are supporting progress towards identifi",
