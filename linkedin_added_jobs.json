    "job_description": "About RipplingRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.About The RoleRippling is a leading Employer of Record (EOR) provider, enabling businesses to hire globally while ensuring compliance with local labor laws and regulations. As part of their compensation strategy, some EOR customers choose to grant equity to EOR employees, which introduces complex, country-specific payroll, tax, and reporting requirements that Rippling helps support through its EOR Equity Services.The Global Equity Payroll Specialist will join Rippling’s growing Global EOR Equity Services team, reporting to the Global EOR Equity Program Manager. This is a foundational role on a small, specialized team responsible for supporting equity-related payroll and compliance operations for EOR customers and employees across multiple countries.This role is strongly payroll-oriented and operationally focused. Unlike traditional equity administration roles, this position does not manage equity plans, cap tables or grant documentation. Instead, it focuses on guiding customers on how equity-related income is reported through payroll, how tax withholding is calculated, and how equity income appears on pay statements and statutory reporting, within the EOR model where Rippling is the legal employer and the equity is granted and administered by a third-party issuing company (the EOR customer). The role works closely with global payroll, tax, legal, and EOR Operations teams to support accurate equity payroll reporting, tax withholding, remittance, and required compliance filings, while helping to build scalable, well-documented processes as EOR Equity Services continues to grow.What You Will DoEquity payroll, filings, and compliance operationsOwn end-to-end equity workflows for EOR employees, including data collection, validation, payroll reporting, tax withholding, remittance, and compliance filings across multiple jurisdictions. Guide customers on how to correctly report equity-related taxable income in payroll, including which earnings codes to use, how to enter taxable amounts, and how to handle regular pay runs, off-cycle payroll, and payroll corrections. Support payroll processing for equity events such as stock option exercises and RSU vesting, ensuring equity income is configured correctly for local tax and social contribution treatment. Explain equity-related payroll outcomes to customers and employees, including:How equity income is treated as imputed income and used solely to calculate tax withholdingWhy equity income may not result in a net cash paymentHow employer and employee withholdings are calculatedHow equity income and taxes appear on pay statements and annual wage reportingHelp customers understand applicable tax withholding approaches for equity income by country, including the use of maximum or supplemental rates where required, while ensuring Rippling payroll calculates and applies final withholding amounts. Partner closely with Global Payroll and Tax Operations teams to ensure equity income is set up correctly in payroll systems, including earnings codes, taxability settings, and downstream reporting impacts. Respond to customer and internal inquiries regarding equity-related payroll treatment, compliance timelines, and documentation requirements. Track country-specific deadlines, filing requirements, and regulatory obligations to ensure timely and accurate execution. Operational analysis and risk managementReview equity transaction data and supporting documentation to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or potential payroll and compliance risks. Escalate complex or non-standard equity payroll, filings, and compliance scenarios to appropriate internal stakeholders for review and guidance. Support analysis of new countries, equity types, or regulatory changes impacting EOR equity payroll and reporting. Process documentation and scalingMaintain trackers, standard operating procedures, and internal reference materials related to equity payroll reporting, filings, and compliance processes. Identify opportunities to improve standardization, documentation, and operational efficiency. Support project",

We have big dreams, and we expect you to have the same.What do you need to have?You need to be qualified from one of the UKs major chartered accounting institutes and have been a real-life CFO/FD once, twice or several times over, with strong experience and understanding of commercial finance, business strategy, and a track record of success, although your “special sauce” is your natural ability to build genuine long-lasting relationships with our clients.

    "job_description": "COO / Chief Operating Officer – home careBased: Dublin (on-site)Some ContextIt happens to us all at some point. Illness, disability or infirmity that limits our capacity to take care of ourselves. None of us want it, and most of us don’t want to leave the security and familiarity of our own home because of it.So, the home care sector is growing very fast (HSE provision has doubled since 2014, to over 22m hours pa), supported by both non-profit and the commercial sector. ‘Non-profit’ could seem an advantage in such a market, however, whereas all providers must meet HIQA quality compliance levels, commercial providers are not also bound by charity regulations – they have greater flexibility to provide the services and care their clients want.There are 60+ private care at home providers in Ireland, but only a few that have the commercial flexibility and efficiency (margins are tight), plus the true dedication to client service and quality that allows them to move ahead in such a competitive marketplace.Getting that balance of flexibility and efficiency right, to build and support an amazing team of carers who will provide the care that is of most value to their clients, whilst also surpassing regulatory and compliance requirements, is a significant operational and organisational challenge.That challenge, and the need to meet significant ongoing growth in demand for services, is the reason we are now searching for a COO. If building the very best care service motivates you, and you have the skill set to make a difference, then read on…The CompanyEstablished in 2012, Right at Home Ireland is the ‘Master Franchisee’ covering the Republic of Ireland for the Right at Home group which provides >1Bn€ of home care services globally. The company serves 1000+ clients in their homes across Ireland, with 200+ dedicated carers and branch operations in 6 locations, plus a further 200+ carers across 3 franchisee-managed locations, and a Dublin Head Office of c20 staff. Overall revenue (currently c14m€) has been growing at >30% annually.Right at Home Ireland is very clear on its mission – “To improve the quality of life for those we serve”, enabling people to remain at home with dignity, independence, and compassionate support.Right at Home Ireland’s Founder-MD is also active in shaping the structure of the sector as a whole (for example, he is currently a Director of Home & Community Care Ireland), and recognises his own need for expert help in growing the provision of care services, whilst also maintaining the highest levels of client care and support for their dedicated carers and support staff.I’ve met team members across the company; they work incredibly hard, and there is a tangible sense of appreciation for their mission – they make a huge difference for their clients and their communities. It’s a respected, growing and profitable business that also has an awareness of “we don’t know what we don’t know” when it comes to scaling and running the company. Part of the solution to this has been the implementation of EOS (the Entrepreneurial Operating System™ - if you’re not yet familiar with this, I’d recommend reading ‘Traction’ by Gino Wickman).Closely linked to EOS, is the key role of the ‘Integrator’ as right hand to a visionary Founder (this relationship is outlined in detail in the book ‘Rocket Fuel’, also by Gino Wickman).That’s the person we are searching for now – an ‘Integrator’ as Chief Operating Officer, to take leadership and management responsibility for all areas of the business, working alongside the Founder-MD to act as an analytical ‘filter’ for future strategy and plans, plus allowing him to focus on expanding the business with quality of service first in mind. Then communicating and working closely with leaders and operational teams to ensure effective implementation and execution of agreed plans.Brief overview of this Integrator role:In one word, this role is about ‘enablement’ – through operational support, it must enable Carers to deliver the required care and compassion, with efficiency and pleasure. All whilst creating profit to invest in further expansion.Integrating all major operating functions of the business nationally. Ensuring everyone is rowing together in the same direction. Model the way, always working toward the greater good of the business (clients, team and owners).Ensure the consistently high-quality provision of services, with support for all people involved, and fully aligned with HIQA standards and HSE expectations.Build and execute the business plan, achieving or exceeding planned P&L objectives.Lead, manage and hold colleagues accountable for achieving agreed-upon commitments across all business functions.Resolving issues effectively – seeing real problems, being comfortable with conflict, calling out the problems, and solving the problems in a practical and healthy manner. Ensure the leadership team is healthy, functional and cohesive.Ensure that everyone is truly following and ",
