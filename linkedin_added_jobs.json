This requires strong observation skills and keen attention to detail. Incorrect information can throw a budget off track and cause incorrect reporting.Problem-solving skills: Junior Accountants work closely with the accounting team and upper management. The ability to identify a problem and resolve it appropriately is critical to resolving potential mistakes. Reconciling accounts requires a comparison between reports, accounts and line items. Locating a discrepancy and resolving the error is easiest when you can identify the problem and take the steps to resolve it without excessive time spent.Skill with technology: Junior Accountants will benefit most from being adept with technology. Accounting software, spreadsheet programs and standard email are all key elements in this type of work. Being comfortable with these programs will enable the candidate to succeed as a Junior Accountant.Communication: Because Junior Accountants interact with multiple staff members, the ability to communicate clearly and effectively is beneficial to a productive individual.

    "job_description": "This is a general track role, hiring for opportunities across all levels of seniority in our Sales Teams.Apply here if you believe you possess outstanding revenue generating experience from the Technology industry.Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete an",

Other outcomes may range from one-time cash settlements to exits before reputational risk materialize, debt for equity and conversions, and enforcement of collateral with resulting business or asset sales.SOU carefully balances purely commercial remedies against the development, social and environmental mandate of the Bank when assessing resolution strategies, whilst managing the overall reputation of the Bank.In addition to managing the SOU portfolio of underperforming and distressed projects, it also shares lessons learnt with NSO departments with respect to the identification of “early warning signs”.

At the same time, we’re shaping the future of investing while actively driving the economies we serve by promoting local investment products.History has shown that investing is the single greatest way to build long-term wealth, but before Thndr, only a very small percentage of people had access to it due to:High barriers to entry — In the form of excessive minimum account balances, complex, outdated onboarding, and low financial literacy. Irrelevant experience — Catered toward expert traders and financial specialists, therefore alienating the majority of the population. Fragmented offering — Investment products were not gathered in a single, intuitive outlet. We don't just talk about change, we deliver it.
