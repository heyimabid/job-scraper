You’ll challenge AI models on real-world quality control scenarios involving defect identification, measurement tolerances, stitching quality, material consistency, finishing standards, and production compliance. This project focuses on evaluating how well models understand manufacturing workflows, common failure points, and quality decision-making at scale.On a typical day, you will review and discuss garment quality inspection scenarios with the model, verify whether model reasoning aligns with real factory QC practices, evaluate defect classification and severity assessment, analyze inspection workflows across production stages, capture recurring model errors, and suggest improvements to training prompts and evaluation criteria.General experience in garment manufacturing environments is ideal, including familiarity with sewing outputs, production lines, and inspection checkpoints. This project does not require advanced technical education; practical factory-floor experience in quality checking or garment inspection is strongly valued. Clear communication and the ability to explain quality judgments and production realities are essential.Ready to turn your garment manufacturing QC expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will help improve manufacturing quality worldwide.We offer a pay range of $6-to-$15 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high-speed internet; company-sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.Project Title: Garment Manufacturing QC Specialist – Freelance AI Trainer ProjectEmployment type: Freelance / ContractWorkplace type: Remote",
